<h3>About</h3>
<p>I'm currently a Ph.D. student in computer science at North Carolina State University. 
  My advisor is <a href="http://menzies.us">Dr. Tim Menzies</a>.
  Previously a software engineer intern at Lexisnexis Risk Solutions in Solution and Architecture Team
  and before that a Software Engineer at Samsung Mobile working in Memory & File System.

<h3>Projects</h3>
<h4>Performance Prediction of Configurable System</h4>
  <p>
  As a part of my Ph.D., I am exploring ways to easily optimize non-functional properties (e.g. runtime, latency etc.)
  of highly configurable systems. Techniques like spectral learning and rank based learning is used to learn features 
    of the configurations. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08106">paper1</a>, 
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05701.pdf">paper2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05018">paper3</a>.
  </p>

<h4>Finding Best Cloud Configuration for a given Software System</h4>
  <p>
  This is a joint project with my colleague, <a href="http://kmweb.info//">Chin-Jung Hsu</a>. We wanted to develop
  fast searching techniques, which are efficient, effective and robust, to find the best configuration in the cloud. 
  The methods proposed uses low-level performance metrics to predict resource requirements which can be then used to 
  eliminate `less promising' configurations and hence searches only the spotlight region of the configuration space.

<h4>SWAY - {S}ampling {WAY}</h4>
  <p>
  This is a joint project with my colleague, <a href="http://ginfung.github.io/">Jianfeng Chen</a>. We wanted to develop
  fast searching techniques, which can be used to optimize problems rather quickly. We have tried the searchers on various 
  problems. This has resulted in few publications. <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-47106-8_7">paper1</a>, 
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07617">paper2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07950.pdf">paper3</a>.

<h3>Open Source Contributions</h3>
  <h4>HPCC Spark Integrator</h4>
  <p>
    At LexisNexis, I worked on the developing a python package, which can be used to import (sampled) data stored in
    <a href="https://hpccsystems.com/">HPCC</a>  cluster to a local machine. This was achieved using the web services exposed 
    by the HPCC platform. The prototype is available <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hpcc-i-spark">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>HPCC - Data Science Portal - Machine Learning Plugins</h4>
  <p>

    During Summer'16, I worked on developing machine learning plugins for Data Science Portal (DSP). DSP is a 
    graphical toolkit, which runs HPCC under the hood. It relieves the users to learn or optimize ECL code and provides 
    a graphical interface to generate machine learning pipelines. The code required to adapt the code to DSP required 
    careful porting of the existing ML library. The pull request
    is available <a href="https://github.com/hpcc-systems/ecl-ml/pull/255">here</a>. The work was presented at the HPCC summit as a part of the <a href=http://www.slideshare.net/hpccsystems/hpcc-systems-community-day-research-poster-contest-winners>
    HPCC poster competition</a>. The copy of the poster is available <a href="assets/vivek-hpcc-poster.pdf">here</a>.

  </p>
  
  <h4>HPCC - Testing Suite</h4>
  <p>

    Since, HPCC ML suite was in its nascent stage, I had an opportunity to develop the testing suite for the ML suite. It was
    particularly a very interesting because I got to learn how to use the macros and functionmacros, 
    which are indeed very powerful. The pull request can be found <a href="https://github.com/hpcc-systems/ecl-ml/pull/258">here</a>.

  <h4>Storm</h4>
  <p>
  A naive stab at extending a framework, JMOO - originally developed by <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-krall> Joe Krall </a>. 
    The newer and extended version is called <a href="https://github.com/ai-se/storm">Storm</a>. The newer version has 
    new algorithms like <a href="https://github.com/ai-se/storm/tree/master/Algorithms/MOEA_D">MOEA/D</a>, 
    <a href="https://github.com/ai-se/storm/tree/master/Algorithms/NSGAIII">NSGA-III</a> along with various other performance measures.
