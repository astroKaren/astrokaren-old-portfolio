<h3>About</h3>
<p>I'm currently a PhD student in computer science at North Carolina State University.
  Previously a software engineer intern at Lexisnexis Risk Solutions in Solution and Architecture Team
  and before that a Software Engineering at Samsung Mobile working in Memory & File System.
  My <a href="assets/vivek-resume.pdf">Resume</a>.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<h4>Performance Prediction of Configurable System</h4>
  <p>
  As a part of my Ph.D., I am exploring ways to easily optimize non-functional properties (e.g. runtime, latency etc.)
  of highly configurable systems. Techniques like spectral learning and rank based learning is used to learn features 
  of the configurations.
  </p>
  
<h4>SWAY - {S}ampling {WAY}</h4>
  <p>
  This is a joint project with my colleague, <a href="http://ginfung.github.io/">Jianfeng Chen</a>. We wanted to develop
  fast searching techniques, which can be used to optimize problems rather quickly. We have tried the searchers on various 
  problems. This has resulted in few publications. <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-47106-8_7">paper1</a>, 
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07617">paper2</a>.
  </p>      
        
<h3>Open Source Contributions</h3>
  <h4>HPCC Spark Integrator</h4>
  <p>
    At LexisNexis, I worked on the developing a python package, which can be used to import (sampled) data stored in
    <a href="https://hpccsystems.com/">HPCC</a>  cluster to a local machine. This was achieved using the web services exposed 
    by the HPCC platform. The prototype is available <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hpcc-i-spark">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>HPCC - Data Science Portal - Machine Learning Plugins</h4>
  <p>

    During Summer'16, I worked on developing machine learning plugins for Data Science Portal (DSP). DSP is a 
    graphical toolkit, which runs HPCC under the hood. It relieves the users to learn or optimize ECL code and provides 
    a graphical interface to generate machine learning pipelines. The code required to adapt the code to DSP required 
    careful porting of the existing ML library. The pull request
    is available <a href="https://github.com/hpcc-systems/ecl-ml/pull/255">here</a>. The work was presented at the HPCC summit as a part of the <a href=http://www.slideshare.net/hpccsystems/hpcc-systems-community-day-research-poster-contest-winners>
    HPCC poster competition</a>. The copy of the poster is available <a href="assets/vivek-hpcc-poster.pdf">here</a>.

  </p>
  
  <h4>HPCC - Testing Suite</h4>
  <p>

    Since, HPCC ML suite was in its nascent stage, I had an opportunity to develop the testing suite for the ML suite. It was
    particularly a very interesting because I got to learn how to use the macros and functionmacros, 
    which are indeed very powerful. The pull request can be found <a href="https://github.com/hpcc-systems/ecl-ml/pull/258">here</a>.

  <h4>NoteSpace</h4>
  <p>

  At Microsoft, I worked on a
  the sticky-notes app designed to take advantage of huge navigable layouts.
  This was supposed to show off Windows 8's API and we made a silly
  <a href="http://youtu.be/-hxFcDk3ITk">demo</a>.

  Also seen on <a
    href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/16/windows-8-on-a-laptop-in-depth-preview-video/">
    engadget</a>
   though it looks like they could have used a manual.

<h3>Random</h3>
  <h4>Item choices in League:</h4>
  <p>
  A naive stab at trying to quantify the importance of different choices
  players make in purchasing items in league of legends.
  <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/251_report.pdf"> Report</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/edgan8/lolmerchantml"> github</a> for crawler
    and analysis.

  <h4>Lossy Grammar Compression:</h4>
  <p>
  A long-shot project on trying to introduce lossiness into the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequitur_algorithm">
    Sequitur Algorithm
  </a> to get even larger compression ratios.
